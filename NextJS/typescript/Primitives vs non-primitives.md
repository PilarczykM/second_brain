#primitive #non-primitive #mutable-value #immutable-value

The fundamental difference between primitives and non-primitive is that **primitives are #immutable-value  and non-primitive are #mutable-value**.

### Primitive vs non-primitive

- #primitive **Primitive**:- (String ,Boolean, Number, BigInt, Null, Undefined, Symbol)
  - are **compared by value**
- #non-primitive **Non-Primitive**:- Object (array, functions) also called object references.
  - are **compared by reference**

### Mutable vs immutable

- #mutable-value**Mutable values** are those which can be modified after creation.
  - **Non-Primitives** are known as `mutable` data types because we can change the value after creation.
- #immutable-value**Immutable values** are those which cannot be modified after creation.
  - A primitive value can be replaced, but it can’t be directly altered.
